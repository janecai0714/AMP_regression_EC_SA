# Project Title

A BERT-based Transfer Learning Approach for Predicting the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations of Antimicrobial Peptides for \textit{Escherichia coli} and \textit{Staphylococcus aureus}

## Description

Air pollution in Macau has become a serious problem following the Pear River Delta's (PRD) rapid industrializatio nthat begain in the 1990s. 
Two regions in Macau were selected to do this the air quality forecast project: Macao roadside and Macao residential. 
For Macao roadside, there were four pollutants (CO, NO2, PM10, PM25) have availabel data.
As for Macao residential, there were six pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM25, SO2) have availabel data. 
For each pollutants in these regions, two machine learning model groups: tradtional machine models (random forest, support vector machine) and deep learning models (artificial neural networks, recurrent neural network, long short-term memory network, gated recurrent units network), were applied to create predictive models to forecast pollutant concentrations for the next 24 h given the previous 3 days data. 

## Getting Started

### Python packages

* tensorflow 2.6.2

### Executing program

* run model/tradtional_model.py to build traditional models.
* run model/dl_model.py to build deep learning models.
